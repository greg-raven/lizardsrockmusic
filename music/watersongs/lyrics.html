			<h3>
				Sardines, Hey!!
			</h3>
			<p>
				Every morning by the bayside,<br>
				See the people standing in line,<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Sardines, hey!, and pork and beans, hey!<br>
				Every morning when I go to the store,<br>
				I see the people asking for more &hellip;<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Bridge:<br>
				Got sardines on a Monday, hey, hey!<br>
				Got sardines on a Tuesday, hey, hey!<br>
				Got sardines on a Wednesday, hey, hey!<br>
				Got sardines on my plate and I don&rsquo;t need no steak.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				A long time ago in Monterey Bay,<br>
				All the fishing boats spent their long day with.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Some years later folks looked up in surprise,<br>
				Sardines had vanished, now they&rsquo;re eating French Fries,<br>
				Chorus: &hellip;<br>
				Bridge: &hellip;<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Now in Monterey they have a new crop,<br>
				Folks from &rsquo;round the world, they come here to shop,<br>
				Chorus:
			</p>
			<h3>
				Rivers of Texas
			</h3>
			<p>
				We crossed the broad Pecos and forded the Nueces,<br>
				We swam the Guadalupe and followed the Brazos,<br>
				Red River runs rusty, the Wichita clear,<br>
				But down by the Brazos I courted my dear.<br>
				So li li li lee lee lee, give me your hand, (3X)<br>
				There&rsquo;s many a river that waters the land.<br>
				The fair Angelina runs glossy and gliding,<br>
				The crooked Colorado runs weaving and winding,<br>
				The slow Antonio it courses the plain,<br>
				But I never will walk by the Brazos again.<br>
				Li li li lee lee lee pole the boat on, (3X)<br>
				My Brazos sweetheart has left me and gone.<br>
				She kissed me, she hugged me,<br>
				she called me her dandy,<br>
				The Trinity&rsquo;s muddy, the Brazos quick-sandy,<br>
				She hugged me she kissed me, she called me her own,<br>
				But down by the Brazos she left me alone.<br>
				Li li li lee lee lee give me your hand, (3X)<br>
				The Trinity&rsquo;s muddy, the Brazos quicksand.<br>
				The girls of Little River, they&rsquo;re plump and they&rsquo;re pretty,<br>
				The Sabine and Sulpher have many a beauty,<br>
				On the banks of the Natchez there&rsquo;s girls by the score,<br>
				But down by the Brazos I&rsquo;ll wander no more.

			<h3>
				Talking Nautical
			</h3>
			<p>
				by Sam Hinton
			</p>
			<p>
				As I went on a ship one day,<br>
				A good old sailor to me did say,<br>
				<q>I&rsquo;m gonna teach you the words to say<br>
				Whenever you go to sea.<br>
				You never say<br>
				floor, you gotta say deck<br>
				wall, you gotta say bulkhead<br>
				upstairs, you gotta say topside<br>
				bed, you gotta say bunk<br>
				bathroom, you gotta say head<br>
				kitchen, you gotta say galley<br>
				That&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re supposed to talk<br>
				whenever you go to sea.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				When I retired from the sea,<br>
				That good old sailor, he came to tea<br>
				I said <q>You better learn to talk like me<br>
				whenever you come ashore.<br>
				You never say<br>
				galley, you gotta say kitchen<br>
				head, you gotta say bathroom<br>
				bunk, you gotta say bed<br>
				topside, you gotta say upstairs<br>
				bulkhead, you gotta say wall<br>
				deck, you gotta say floor<br>
				That&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re supposed to talk<br>
				whenever you come ashore!</q>

			<h3>
				Squid Jiggin&rsquo; Ground
			</h3>
			<p>
				by Arthur R. Scammell
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, this is the place where the fishermen gather,<br>
				With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down,<br>
				All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers,<br>
				They congregate here on the squid jiggin&rsquo; ground.<br>
				Some are workin&rsquo; their jiggers while others are yarnin&rsquo;<br>
				There&rsquo;s some standin&rsquo; up but there&rsquo;s more lyin&rsquo; down,<br>
				While all kinds of fun, jokes, and tricks are begun,<br>
				As they wait for the squid on the squid jiggin&rsquo; ground.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				The squid jiggin&rsquo; ground is out on the bay,<br>
				We&rsquo;ll light all the lights, turn the night into day.<br>
				There&rsquo;s men from the harbor and boys from the tickle,<br>
				In all kinds of motorboats, green, gray and brown,<br>
				Right yonder is Bobby, and with him is Nobby,<br>
				They&rsquo;re chawin&rsquo; hard tack on the squid jiggin&rsquo; ground;<br>
				The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele,<br>
				He&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; well up, but he&rsquo;s still pretty sound,<br>
				While Uncle Tom Hawkins wears six pairs of stockin&rsquo;s<br>
				Whenever he&rsquo;s out on the squid jiggin&rsquo; ground.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				There&rsquo;s poor Uncle Billy, his whiskers are splattered<br>
				With spots of the squid juice that&rsquo;s flyin&rsquo; around,<br>
				One poor little b&rsquo;y got it right in the eye,<br>
				But they don&rsquo;t give a darn on the squid jiggin&rsquo; ground.<br>
				Now, if you&rsquo;ve ever a mind to go squiddin&rsquo;<br>
				Leave your white skirts and petticoats behind in the town,<br>
				And if you get cranky without your silk hanky,<br>
				You&rsquo;d better steer clear of the squid jiggin&rsquo; ground.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Dance To Your Daddy
			</h3>
			<p>
				Dance to your daddy, my little babby,<br>
				Dance to your daddy, my little lamb<br>
				You shall have a fishy in a little dishy<br>
				You shall have a fishy when the boat comes in.
			</p>

				We&rsquo;ll work tomorrer, but not terday,<br>
				John Kanaka naka, tuie ay. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				We&rsquo;re bound away for Frisco Bay,<br>
				We&rsquo;re bound away at the break of day. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				We&rsquo;re bound away around Cape Horn,<br>
				It makes us wish we&rsquo;d never been born. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				A Yankee ship with a Yankee crew,<br>
				Oh, we&rsquo;re the buckos fer to push her through.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Oh haul, Oh haul, Oh haul away,<br>
				Oh haul away fer to make your pay.<br>
				Chorus:

				Mingulay Boat Song
			</h3>
			<p>
				Chorus:<br>
				Eel ya o, boys, let her go, boys,<br>
				Head her &rsquo;round, now all together<br>
				Eel ya o, boys, and we&rsquo;ll anchor<br>
				As the sun sets in Mingulay.<br>
				What care we how wide the Minch is?<br>
				What care we for windy weather?<br>
				Let her &rsquo;round, boys, pull your oars hard,<br>
				Sailing homeward to Mingulay. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Bairns are laughing, wives are waiting<br>
				Look and see you hills of heather,<br>
				Sail her on now, toward the homeland,<br>
				While the sun sets on Mingulay.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Wives are waiting, by the harbor,<br>
				They&rsquo;ve been waiting since break of day,<br>
				Wives are waiting at the harbor,<br>
				As the sun sets on Mingulay,<br>
				Chorus:

			<p>
				(<q>Eel ya o</q> means <q>Heave your oars.</q>)

			<h3>
				Emily Fish
			</h3>
			<p>
				Traditional music, words by Nancy Raven
			</p>
			<p>
				Chorus:<br>
				Yo ho ho, The light shines free,<br>
				thanks to the work of Emily!<br>
				Oh, Emily was the keeper of the Pt. Pinos Light,<br>
				She kept that beacon burning bright,<br>
				One day she&rsquo;d shine up all the glass<br>
				The next day she polished up all the brass. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				When Emily first moved into the house,<br>
				All she found living in the yard was a field mouse,<br>
				So in her spare time she worked outside,<br>
				Putting in a garden, which became her pride. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				There was a fountain, roses, and blooms all around,<br>
				Another lighthouse like it just couldn&rsquo;t be found.<br>
				Prize hens, horses, and Holsteins to see,<br>
				And on Sundays the public was invited to tea. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				One night there was a racket down in the hen house,<br>
				As Emily neared the barn<br>
				she heard some might big growls,<br>
				To her surprise she found a grizzly bear,<br>
				She whomped him with a rake and<br>
				chased him out of there!<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Everyone who visited while Emily was there,<br>
				Said the old lighthouse had never seen better care,<br>
				For twenty one years her work shone through,<br>
				Keeping boats off the rocks when the skies weren&rsquo;t blue.
			</p>
			<h3>
				I&rsquo;ze The B&rsquo;y
			</h3>
			<p>
				Chorus:<br>
				I&rsquo;ze the b&rsquo;y that builds the boat,<br>
				And I&rsquo;ze the b&rsquo;y that sails her,<br>
				I&rsquo;ze the b&rsquo;y that catches the fish,<br>
				And takes them home to Lizer.<br>
				So hip your partner, Sally Tipple,<br>
				Hip your partner Sally Brown,<br>
				Over the bay to Monterey,<br>
				All around the circle.<br>
				I took Lizer to a dance,<br>
				And faith and she could travel,<br>
				And every step that she would take,<br>
				Was up to her knees in gravel. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Salts and rinds to cover your flake,<br>
				Cake and tea for supper,<br>
				Codfish in the spring of the year,<br>
				Fried in maggoty butter. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Susan White, she&rsquo;s out of sight,<br>
				Her petticoat wants a border,<br>
				Old Sam Oliver in the dark,<br>
				Kissed her in the corner. <br>
				Chorus:
			</p>
			<h3>
				Gum Tree Canoe
			</h3>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ll sing you a ditty, a sweet little song,<br>
				It will take just a moment, it won&rsquo;t keep you long,<br>
				I&rsquo;ll sing of the days when our love was still new,<br>
				As we sailed down the River Murray, boys,<br>
				In a gum tree canoe.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				We rowed, we rowed, o&rsquo;er the water so blue,<br>
				Like a feather we would float along, in a gum tree canoe.<br>
				My hand on the banjo, my toe on the oar,<br>
				I work all the day and I sing as I go,<br>
				And at night time I turn to my Julia so true,<br>
				As we sail down the River Murray, boys,<br>
				In a gum tree canoe.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				We&rsquo;re floating along, our lines at the lee,<br>
				I&rsquo;d soon fish this river as go out to sea,<br>
				And at night time my thoughts turn to my Julia so true,<br>
				As we sail down the River Murray, boys,<br>
				In a gum tree canoe. <br>
				Chorus:<br>
				So this is my boat, so trim and so strong,<br>
				Come join us, the river will take you along,<br>
				Hear the music afar from the didgeridoo,<br>
				As we sail down the River Murray, boys,<br>
				In a gum tree canoe.<br>
				Chorus:
			</p>
			<h3>
				Donkey Riding (Hieland Laddie)
			</h3>
			<p>
				Were you ever in Quebec,<br>
				Loading timber on the deck,<br>
				Where there&rsquo;s a queen with a golden crown,<br>
				Riding on a donkey?<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Hey, ho, away we go,<br>
				Donkey riding, donkey riding,<br>
				Hey ho, away we go,<br>
				Riding on a donkey.<br>

				Stowing cotton all the day?<br>
				A dollar a day is all they pay,<br>
				Riding on a donkey. <br>

				There&rsquo;s some pretty ships you&rsquo;ll see,<br>

			<h3>
				Abalone Song
			</h3>
			<p>
				Chorus:<br>
				Abalone [abalone], abalone [abalone]<br>
				Abalone [abalone] &hellip; and chunks of abalone. (2x)<br>
				In Monterey, the people say,<br>
				They like to feed a crony<br>
				On caramels and cockle shells<br>
				And chunks of abalone.<br>
				Chorus:<br>
				Oh some like ham, and some jam<br>
				where e&rsquo;er the coast is stony<br>
				But our tom cat stays nice and fat<br>
				On chunks of abalone.<br>
				I telegraph my better half<br>
				By Morse or by Marconi,<br>
				But when in need of greater speed,<br>
				I send an abalone.<br>
				In old Carmel, the ocean swell<br>
				Of turquoise waves looks phony,<br>
				They dine with wine and food so fine,<br>
				And chunks of abalone.<br>
				Down in P.G., by the rocks and the sea,<br>
				the kids eat macaroni<br>
				Their folks sneak out for sauerkraut,<br>
				and chunks of abalone.<br>
				On Pfeiffer Beach what did I see,<br>
				while listening to my Sony?<br>
				Two folks a-throwing their Frisbee<br>
				Made of abalone.
			</p>
