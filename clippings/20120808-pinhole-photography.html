			<p>
				Five years ago, Minden resident Nancy Raven took a pinhole photography class and fell in love with the process.
			</p>
			<p>
				On Monday, the 83-year-old&rsquo;s pinhole photography exhibit opens 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Carson Valley Arts Council.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I fell in love with the technique and the types of pictures you get from it. They are just really beautiful,</q> Raven said. <q>There&rsquo;s a lot of failure. It&rsquo;s such a chancy medium. I&rsquo;ve taken at least 500 to 1,000 photographs over the years, and when you end up with a good print you get very excited.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Raven moved to Carson Valley in 2010 from Monterey, Calif., where she performed children&rsquo;s music for 50 years. She continues performing music part-time during the library&rsquo;s summer reading program and storytime in the park.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I&rsquo;m basically retired, but I do a lot of art and photography,</q> she said. <q>I&rsquo;ve become a gardener here. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in the yard doing that and photography.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead of using film, pinhole photography uses photographic paper inside a light-proof can or box with a pinhole in it. The camera is then pointed toward the subject and the hole is uncovered for about one to two minutes to get the exposure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>The difficulty is placing the camera right so you get what you want to photograph. You can&rsquo;t put it on a tripod</q> Raven said. <q>There&rsquo;s no instant gratification like you have with digital. You have to quiet down and wait for the process.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Raven develops her own film, and prefers to use large popcorn cans for her cameras because of the look it gives to the photograph.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I have about 13 cans I load up and take out with me. You only get one shot per camera,</q> she said. <q>I find them easy to secure in terms of light. I also like the distortion, everything has a curve to it.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				In her exhibit, Raven displays 30 of her photographs, mostly taken in Carson Valley.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>There will be a couple small ones of a hotel series I did in Russia, and a couple of the Carson City governor&rsquo;s mansion,</q> she said. <q>I really love what I see here in Carson Valley. I love old ranches, old barns. I love what I find here both in old buildings and scenery.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				An artist&rsquo;s reception is 4-7 p.m., Aug. 17 at the arts council where Raven will give a demonstration of pinhole photography and allow guests to see how the cameras work.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I&rsquo;m really thrilled to have the opportunity to do the work, it&rsquo;s really unusual,</q> Raven said. <q>To have the whole show of pinhole and have the explanation will be nice. I&rsquo;m grateful to the arts council for letting me do this.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Raven&rsquo;s pinhole photography exhibit runs through Sept. 13. The hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Carson Valley Arts Council is located at 1572 Highway 395. For more information call 782-4119.
