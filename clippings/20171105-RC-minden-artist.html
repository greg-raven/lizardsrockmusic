				Minden artist at Copeland Gallery
			</h1>
			<p>
				Carson Valley Arts Council (CVAC) presents local artist Nancy Raven at the Copeland Gallery in Minden from Nov. 9 through Jan. 1. The exhibit can be viewed 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Raven&rsquo;s photographs are available for purchase.
			</p>
			<p>
				Around 2005 Raven retired from performing and teaching music, and took some photography classes. One class was taught by Henry Gilpin, a fine photographer in the Monterey/Carmel region, who worked with Ansel Adams and the Westons. The other class was with Martha Casanave, in portraiture and lensless photography.
			</p>
			<p>
				After working with Gilpin, Raven photographed the Fort Ord buildings as they were being torn down and falling into disrepair. Raven named the group of photographs <q>Disappearing Structures.</q> The photographs are both in black and white and in color. Her show was seen at the Pacific Grove Art Center in Pacific Grove and at the Seaside Community Center.
			</p>
			<p>
				The classes with Casanave, a master in pinhole photography, gave Raven a passion for this type of photography, and by 2007, she had assimilated a number of popcorn cans and made numerous photographs. Raven&rsquo;s first pinhole photography exhibit occurred after she moved to the Carson Valley in 2010.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her exhibit appeared at the Copeland Gallery in Minden in 2012.
			</p>
			<p>
				While living in Monterey, Raven said, <q>I walked on the beach every day. Often there would be a tiny shoe tangled up in the seaweed or just on the sand &hellip; all by itself. By the time I moved to Nevada I had over 35 in my collection, kept in a large basket by the front door. The idea of making an art project came to me &hellip; and you see the results. Only solo shoes were picked up.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to her photography, Raven is also an accomplished musician and author.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of Raven&rsquo;s photographs can be viewed at https://www.lizardrockmusic.com.
			</p>
			<p>
				CVAC will be hosting an artist&rsquo;s reception on Nov. 17 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Refreshments will be served and it is free to the public.
			</p>
