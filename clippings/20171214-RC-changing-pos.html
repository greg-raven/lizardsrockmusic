				Changing Post Offices throughout Nevada
			</h1>
			<p>
				Here&rsquo;s a book you should know about. <q><a href="/books/a-postal-journey.html">A Postal Journey: Discovering Nevada Through Its Post Offices</a>,</q> written by local artist and musician, Nancy Raven, is a one-of-a-kind resource. Upon moving to Nevada, Raven wanted to learn more about her new home state. After reading an article mentioning how many old post offices were closing, she set out to visit and photograph them before they were gone.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may meet the author this Saturday at a book signing from 10 a.m.-noon at Copeland Gallery, 1572 US Hwy 395, Minden. An exhibit of Raven&rsquo;s work is also on display there from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Saturday now through Jan.1.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her state adventures exploring the state began in 2010, when she mapped out where each post office was located starting with Gardnerville, Genoa, Zephyr Cove and Washoe. Raven ended up covering at least 5,000 miles for a total of 17 different trips during a two-year period.
			</p>
			<p>
				Local area mail carriers were of help locating the old post office buildings that had been replaced with new, and many residents in the various cities she visited enthusiastically shared their personal stories.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>A Postal Journey: Discovering Nevada Through Its Post Offices,</q> can be purchased in time for Christmas locally at Copeland Gallery (see address above), GadZooks, 1492 Highway 395 No. 104, Gardnerville; and the Copeland Gallery, 1572 Highway 395, Unit A, Minden.
