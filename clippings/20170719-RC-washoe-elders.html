				Photo display depicting portraits of Washoe elders wraps July 21
			</h1>
			<p>
				GARDNERVILLE, Nev. &mdash; A photography show by Minden, Nevada, artist Nancy Raven highlights an often-overlooked population in the Carson Valley &mdash; the Washoe people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Raven captured images of some of the Valley&rsquo;s oldest native citizens in a series of portraits she is displaying at the Douglas County Historical Society.
			</p>
			<p>
				The show, titled <q>Tribal Elders,</q> opened in June and runs through July 21. It features about three dozen 11&times;14 matted and framed portraits of Washoe elders, both in black and white and in color.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I feel so strongly these beautiful people need to be remembered somehow,</q> said Raven, 88, of Minden. <q>There are so many elders who won&rsquo;t be around much longer.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Raven started the project about a year ago. She visited local reservations and started asking people if they were interested in being photographed.
			</p>
			<p>
				She said the reception was cool at first, but after one woman agreed and invited her to her home, others soon followed in consenting.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>Once they saw how it was going to be done, they began to take an interest,</q> she said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Raven repaid anyone willing to have their portrait taken with color and black and white copies of the images.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is not Raven&rsquo;s first foray into preserving Native American history. In 2008 her book <q>Wuzzie Comes to Camp,</q> profiling a Paiute woman named Wuzzie George, was published.
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>I got hooked on the Nevada native American tradition,</q> she said. <q>It&rsquo;s important to pay attention to the elders and honor them and our native people generally.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Since completing this project, more Washoe people have contacted her, and she hopes to compile enough portraits to do a second show next year, she said. She also hopes to show the images at other local venues.
